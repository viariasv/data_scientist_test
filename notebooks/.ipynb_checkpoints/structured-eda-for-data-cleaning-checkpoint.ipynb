    "1. A practice dataset that we know has some issues. Cleaning data is a very open ended problem, so practice is really the single most valuable thing we can offer you. We'll use the credit card dataset from [the R package AER](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AER/AER.pdf).\n",
    "- A basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) process for error detection that you can apply to other datasets. There's no one true way, but this is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the most out of this tutorial you should fork this notebook and implement each EDA step on your own. Then, make a list of potential problems with the data. I'll provide a link to my version of the completed exercises at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the exercises can be done with single line pandas commands, so if you find yourself writing much code I recommend pausing to look at the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html) or answer key."
